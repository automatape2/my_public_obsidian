## Episode 1
**Interviewer:** 
In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around premiered on ABC. The show, in which young, bachelor horse is forced to reevaluated his priorities when he agrees to raise three human children was  initially dismissed by critics as broad and saccharina and not good. But the family comedy struck a chord with America and went on to air for nine seasons. The star of Horsin' Around Bojack Horseman, is our guest tonight. Welcome, Bojack.

**Bojack Horseman:**
It is good to be here, Charlie. Sorry I was late. The traffic...

**Charlie (Interviewer):**
It's really no problem

**Bojack Horseman:**
I parked in a handicapped spot. I hope that's okay

**Charlie:**
You parked in a...

**Bojack Horseman:**
I'm sorry, disabled spot.
Is that the proper nomenclature?

**Charlie:**
Maybe you should move the car.

**Bojack:**
No, I don't think
I should drive right now.
I'm incredubly drunk 

**Charlie:**
You're telling me that you're drunk right now?

**Bojack:**
is it just me, or am I nailing this interview?
I kink of feel like I'm nailing it.

**Charlie:**
 Yes
 Anyway, we were talking about Horsin' Around
 To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal?

**Bojack:**
Charlie, listen, you know
I know that it's very hip these days to shit all over Horsin' Around, but at the time...
I can tell you---
Is it okey to say "shit"?

**Charlie:**
Please dont

**Bojack:**
Cause I--- I thind the show's actually pretty sold for what it is
It's not Ibsen, sure, but look, for a lot of people life is just one long, hard, kick in the urethra and  sometimes when you get home from a long day of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what happens, at the end of 30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay.
You know, because in real life--- 
Did I already say the thing about the urethra?

**Charlie:**
Well. let's talk about real life.
What have you been doing since the show's cancellation 18 year ago?

**Bojack:**
That's a great question, Charlie
I, uh ...
Uh, I ...
Um ...
